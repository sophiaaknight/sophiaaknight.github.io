<p>I recently graduated from MSc Digital Sociology at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied the impact of digital technologies on culture, society and institutions.
	In addition to my data skills, I hold a BA in English and Philosophy from the University of Sheffield, and am a published poet. 
	My research integrates creative and critical data analysis
	
	computational social science techniques into mixed-methods analyses of large-scale cultural phenomena, such as podcasting.
