In June 2022, I participated in the Edinburgh [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/2022/edinburgh/). This consisted of sixteen workshops of training in current research, ongoing debates and the latest methods within this emerging field, bringing together [scholars and participants](https://sicss.io/2022/edinburgh/people) from across disciplines, including Computer Science, Informatics, Humanities and Social Sciences.

For the final group project, [Huang Huichao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huichao-huang-280b34228/) and myself used a combination of Named Entity Recognition and Word Embeddings to tell the story of 'Dream of the Red Chamber', a classical Chinese novel by Cao Xueqin. As Huichao unfortunately fell ill in the final days of SICSS, I produced the simplified visualisations for the slides and led the presentation.
