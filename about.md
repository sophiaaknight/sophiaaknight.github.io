<p>I recently graduated from MSc Digital Sociology at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied the impact of digital technologies on culture, society and institutions.</p>

<p>I hold a BA in English and Philosophy from the University of Sheffield, and am a published poet. These experiences have enabled me to develop a human-centered approach to working with data, drawing on interdisciplinary insights.</p>

<p>In my research, I utilise social data science and qualitative methods to produce creative and critical analysis into social and cultural phenomena, ranging from podcasts to AI.</p>
